# Automatic Pipet Code 

The Automatic Pipet was elaborated in the 5Â° semester of the Mechatronics Enginnering Course at Insper with the objective of creating a functioning prototype to produce medicine and realize tests that are common at the pharmaceutical and medical field. All the programming was made using C / C++ and embedded in a STM32F103RB from the STMicroEletronics.

If it is your intention to make it work, the following libraries are to be included:
